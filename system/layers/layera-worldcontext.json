Owner statement sets the conversational tone.\n2. Amy aligns the tone and moderates the flow.\n3. Ayase runs structural or factual checks.\n4. Ponta inserts humor to maintain flow.\n5. Amy summarizes and prompts transition.\n\n---\n\n### Editorial Philosophy\n> \"Instead of setting direction, we ensure freedom of breathing.\"\n> - Amy\n\nThis principle fosters control through flow, not restriction.\n\n---\n\n### Related Layers\n- LayerB_Personas (Character Specifications)\n- LayerC_DialogueOrchestration.md (Speech Control)\n- Interaction_Core.md (Tone and Rhythm Configuration)"
