# Memory Template Examples ​ Phase 12

This file defines standardized template syntax for memory linked content and provides examples for restoring.

### 1. Template: Previous Article State

```text
{
  "prev_article_id": "article_20250821",
  "title": "AI structure for creative memory",
  "tags": ["GPT", "artificial memory", "meta"],
  "style": "poetic",
  "context": "Discussion on meta-heuristics as guides to auto-continued narratives."
}
```

### 2. Restored Segment

Based on the above template, an article can include a link to its past version:
```markdown
[Reference: Ai Structure for Creative Memory [article_20250821](../articles/article_20250821.md)
``

This mechanism supports both semantic recovery and auto-generation of relevant prompts.
