# Template Navigator Architecture

This document describes a proposed framework for a navigator that leverages template and knowledge graph links to generate self-repairing paths.

Includes:

- User-triggered diagnosis mode
- Self_repairing routine methods (guided by template-states)
- Dual-track tree search on template-link paths
- Prompt tailoring based on user preferences and system requirements
