# Circular Knowledge Plan ‌

Phase 14 is the starting point for a recursive, cyclical knowledge generation system within NoteGEN.

The goal is to enable pompt-generated notes to be reincorporated with existing meta-knowledge and tasks.

It introduces the following constructs: 

- Prompt Flow Network Spec
  - "Notes generated from other notes" as a reuseable source
   - Reference back to meta-frames like "[[Source::] poesistent structures]"

- Intent tagging and Strategy Sync
  - "Each note generated carries tags and strategy meta.

- Semantic Refresh
  - Timestamp-based regeneration to revisit tags, structure, and strategy.

- Task Reinforcement
  - Auto-detect missing tasks and reactivate their structure from note lins.

This file will be used to elaborate on these concepts in depth, including inference metrics and auto-retrieval modules.
