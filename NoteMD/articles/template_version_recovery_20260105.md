# Template Version Recovery

This document defines a mechanism for handling branched versions of templates and reconstructing prior states.

Includes

- Version tree structures designed to support different change types
- Branch comparison to compute differences and predict conflicts
- Reconstruction algorithms to build templates from baselines of derived versions
