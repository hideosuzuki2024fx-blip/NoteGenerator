# Self-Expanding Prompt Structure ‌ Phase 13

This file specifies the initial draft for a recursive, self-extending prompt structure.

The idea is to design a prompt that generates a new prompt, based on article results or user responses.

### 1. Prompt Template Syntax

A primary pattern:

    [[SELF_REBUILD]]
    * self_context: An summary of the previous response.
    * user_input: The user's current input or query.
    * generated_output: Response generated by the previous prompt.

### 2. Rule Grap

- The prompt must include a rule that defines when and how to update the prompt self.

- Example:
    - If article contains "self_expansion" tag, then regenerate next prompt with the extended section.

### 3. Recursion Logic

- Recursively apply self_expansion to all previous generated prompts.

- Prevent infinetly loops, but neat context hardcoding.

- The system should retain prompts without undesirable drift.

### 4. Validation Checks

- Before regeneration, the prompt structure should be validated:
    * No missing fields
    * No unnecessary nested outputs
    * Variables are well-formed
